### <u>**Introduction** </u>

##### CIFAR-100 is a dataset that consists of over 60,000 images that can be distributed across 100 different classifications. This dataset is recognized for its use in benchmarking image classifications models. The model created throughout this course work is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This report will describe the basic CNN model architecture neeed as well as the convolution layers, pooling strategies and fully connected layers to identify images. The CNN model will then undergo improvements to increase the accuracy in identificating images. 

### <u>**Business Objectives** :</u>
- Achieve high accuracy when classifying images into the 100 distinct classes
- 
- Ensure model functions and produces results when tested with unseen data
